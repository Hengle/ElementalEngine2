		<P>Here will be the default topic.</P>
		<P>There is no help files yet, but you can place some CHMs to "plugins/hlp" 
			directory, restart GDS and see what help system currently can.</P>
		<P>Note, that CHMs&nbsp;should contain topic tree and topic index description, 
			otherwise either&nbsp;tree or index will not be shown by help system. Also they 
			should contain binary&nbsp;index for search (appropriate flag should be 
			specified while compiling CHM), otherwise search for this CHM will not work.</P>
		<P>Currently the search is not works properly due to some bug in libchmxx...</P>
